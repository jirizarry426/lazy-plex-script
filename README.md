# lazy-plex-script
Here is a script that checks if your VPN and Plex Media Server applications are running. If your VPN is not running, the script will open it for you so you can connect to a server before opening Plex Media Server. If your VPN and Plex Media Server is running, it will open Google Chrome as well as a new Plex tab. If ONLY Plex is not running, it will start Plex Media Server and open Google Chrome and a Plex Media Server Tab.


#THIS SCRIPT MAKES USE OF THE VPN SERVICE IPVANISH. IF YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT VPN SERVICE PLEASE CHANGE IT WITHIN THE SCRIPT ITSELF ACCORDINGLY.

#SOMETIMES THE PLEX MEDIA SERVER TAB DOES NOT OPEN WHEN GOOGLE CHROME FIRST OPENS. IN THIS CASE RUN THE SCRIPT AGAIN.


#IF YOU ARE USING A DIFFERENT BROWSER THAN CHROME, CHANGE IT TO YOUR APPROPRIATE BROWSER
